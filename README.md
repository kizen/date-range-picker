## Future:

* Tests
* Redo styling - currently utilizes a massive stylesheet, want to move to emotion or something else
  * this would require Kizen to export its styleguide or make it consumable
* Cleanup a lot of the unused code - idea is this library should be good for now but we should aim to improve it every time its touched
* Better mobile responsive design
* Move this to a github package? - free and private!
